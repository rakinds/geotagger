## Information
This repository contains all code used for this thesis project. To run the geotagger, create the gazetteer by running `make_gazetteer.py`. For this you will need the files `NL.txt`, `cities500.txt` and `countries.txt` from the `data/gazetteer/` folder. Once the gazetteer is created, the system can be used by running `geotagger.py`.
