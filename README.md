# Geotagger BSc Thesis Information Science
## Information
This repository contains all code used for my thesis project. To run the code, the gazetteer can be made by running `make_gazetteer.py`. To run this, you will need the files `NL.txt`, `cities500.txt` and `countries.txt` from the data folder. Once the gazetteer is created, the system can be used by running `geotagger.py`.
